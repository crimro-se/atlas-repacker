# Atlas Repacker

This is a tool made to identify pixel islands in an image and repack them onto a new canvas of a specified size, with optional padding between such islands.

actual packing is deferred to https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_rect_pack.h

I needed this for some specific AI training, it may or may not fit your needs.
